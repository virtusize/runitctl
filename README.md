# Runitctl

This is prototype. It still is even not an alpha.

## The Idea
It would be nice if we could have [runit](http://smarden.org/runit/) supervisor backend with [supervisorctl](http://supervisord.org/running.html#running-supervisorctl) UI

## Status
* ~~start/stop~~
* restart
* status
* avail
* reread
* update
* signal 
* add/remove
